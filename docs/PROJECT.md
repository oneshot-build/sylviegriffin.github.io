# Vision Document

## 1. The Idea

**What is it?** — A professional website showcasing Sylvie's services as a life coach, yoga teacher, reiki practitioner, and conscious travel guide.

**The elevator pitch** — This is Sylvie's digital home where people can discover her unique blend of personal development services and book sessions to transform their lives. It's designed to establish her as a trusted reference in helping people find their true purpose and live more fulfilling lives.

## 2. Why This Matters

**The motivation** — Sylvie believes these services represent her core identity and mission on earth — what she's meant to offer the world.

**The opportunity** — Too many people are stuck pursuing money and traditional success symbols at the cost of their happiness, missing their true calling.

**Personal connection** — This website is how Sylvie shares her belief that everyone has a specific mission on earth, and when they find and serve it, they live fulfilling lives where abundance naturally flows.

## 3. The Dream Outcome

**If this succeeds...** — People will recognize Sylvie as a respected reference in personal development, particularly coaching, and the world becomes a better place as more people follow their hearts.

**For the creator** — Sylvie becomes known as a trusted expert who commands premium rates for her transformational services.

**For users** — People discover their unique path, align with their true purpose, and experience the fulfillment and abundance that comes from living authentically.

## 4. What Makes This Different

**Current alternatives** — Most personal development websites focus on one service or use generic approaches that don't address the deeper spiritual mission aspect.

**The gap** — There's a lack of holistic practitioners who combine coaching, yoga, reiki, and conscious travel while focusing on helping people discover their earthly mission.

**The unique angle** — Sylvie's integrated approach addresses mind, body, and spirit while specifically helping people find their unique purpose rather than following cookie-cutter success formulas.

## 5. Initial Scope

**Core focus** — Clearly presenting Sylvie's four service areas and making it easy for potential clients to understand her philosophy and book sessions.

**First version** — A professional showcase that establishes credibility, explains her unique approach to personal development, and provides clear pathways for people to engage her services.

**What it's NOT** — This isn't a blog, online course platform, or community space — it's focused on attracting and converting high-quality clients for one-on-one and small group services.

## 6. Success Signals

**How will you know it's working?** — People are willing to pay premium rates for Sylvie's services and refer to her as a trusted expert in personal development.

**Early wins** — Quality inquiries from people who resonate with her mission-based approach and are ready to invest in transformation.

**Long-term vision** — Sylvie becomes a recognized reference in the personal development industry, particularly known for helping people discover and live their true purpose.

# Users Document

## 1. Who Are They?

**In a nutshell** — Successful professionals in their 30s who've checked all the "right" boxes but feel trapped in a life that doesn't align with who they really are.

**A day in their life** — They wake up to an alarm at 6:30 AM, check emails before coffee, commute to an office where they excel at work they don't love, come home exhausted, scroll through social media seeing others living seemingly authentic lives, and fall asleep wondering "Is this it?" They have the apartment, the salary, the respect — but Sunday nights fill them with dread.

**What they care about** — Deep down, they value authenticity, meaningful work, and personal fulfillment, but they're caught between societal expectations and their inner voice. They care about security but crave purpose. They want to matter beyond their job title.

## 2. The Problem They Face

**The frustration** — They feel like they're living someone else's life. Despite doing everything "right" — getting good grades, landing a prestigious job, climbing the ladder — they feel empty and stuck. The success they worked so hard for feels hollow.

**How often?** — This is a daily, persistent feeling that intensifies during quiet moments — Sunday evenings, vacation endings, milestone birthdays, or when they see others pursuing their passions.

**The trigger** — The moment they realize they're more excited about weekend plans than their actual career, or when someone asks "What do you really want to do?" and they have no answer.

## 3. What They've Tried

**Current workarounds** — They've tried weekend hobbies, meditation apps, self-help books, maybe therapy, or taking "mental health days." Some have considered career pivots but get overwhelmed by the uncertainty.

**Other solutions** — Generic life coaches who focus on productivity, career counselors who suggest lateral moves within their field, or wellness retreats that provide temporary relief but no lasting direction.

**The gap** — Nothing addresses the deeper spiritual question of "What am I actually meant to do with my life?" Most solutions treat symptoms (stress, burnout) rather than the core misalignment with their true purpose.

## 4. What They Really Want

**The surface need** — Better work-life balance, less stress, maybe a career change that still pays well.

**The deeper need** — To discover their unique mission on earth and have the courage to pursue it, even if it means leaving behind the safety of their current life. They want to feel alive and purposeful.

**The dream outcome** — Waking up excited about their day, doing work that feels like their calling, having abundance flow naturally because they're aligned with their purpose, and inspiring others through their authentic example.

## 5. What Would Make Them Switch

**Must-haves** — Someone who understands the complexity of leaving a "successful" life, addresses both practical and spiritual aspects of transformation, and has a proven approach to helping people discover their true calling.

**Dealbreakers** — Generic advice, pressure to make immediate drastic changes, or anyone who dismisses their legitimate concerns about financial security and social expectations.

**The "wow" factor** — Meeting someone who clearly found their own purpose and radiates the fulfillment they're seeking, combined with a holistic approach that addresses mind, body, and spirit in the journey of self-discovery.

## 6. Finding Them

**Where they hang out** — LinkedIn (but feeling disconnected from the corporate cheerleading), wellness-focused Instagram accounts, yoga studios, meditation centers, personal development podcasts, and increasingly, communities focused on career transitions and purpose-driven living.

**How they discover new tools** — Primarily through word-of-mouth recommendations from trusted friends who've made similar transitions, organic social media content that resonates with their struggles, and searching for terms like "finding your purpose" or "career transition coach."

**Who influences them** — Colleagues who've successfully made career pivots, authors like Elizabeth Gilbert or Brené Brown, and anyone who embodies the authentic, purpose-driven life they're seeking while maintaining financial stability.

## 3. How It Works (Simply)

1. User arrives feeling stuck or unfulfilled in their current life
2. They immediately see Sylvie's story — from banking executive to aligned life in Brazil
3. They read her credentials (economist, life coach, yoga teacher, reiki practitioner) and understand she bridges practical and spiritual
4. They encounter inspiring quotes that resonate with their deeper yearning for purpose
5. They feel hope that transformation is possible and book a coaching session

## 4. What Users Get

**The main deliverable** — A scheduled coaching session with someone who has successfully made the transition from conventional success to authentic fulfillment.

**The ongoing value** — Regular inspiration that keeps them connected to their dreams and the possibility of change.

**The "aha" moment** — When they realize Sylvie has the exact combination of practical experience and spiritual wisdom they need to navigate their own transformation.

## 5. What's NOT in Version 1

**Success stories and testimonials** — While powerful, Sylvie's personal story is more compelling than client stories for establishing initial credibility.

**Practical tools (breathing exercises, yoga postures)** — These are valuable but can distract from the primary goal of booking sessions.

**Information about travel/tours in Brazil** — This dilutes focus from the core coaching message and can be added later.

**Blog or content library** — The inspirational quotes provide enough ongoing value without the complexity of content management.

**Multiple service booking (yoga, reiki separately)** — Start with coaching as the primary service and expand later.

## 6. Success Criteria

**Users are succeeding when...** — They're booking quality coaching sessions with Sylvie and expressing that they feel understood and hopeful.

**The app is working when...** — Visitors spend time reading Sylvie's story, engage with the inspirational content, and convert to bookings at a healthy rate.

**Time to value** — Users should feel hope and connection within 30 seconds of landing on the site, with clear next steps to book a session.
